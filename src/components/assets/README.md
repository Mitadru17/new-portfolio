# Asset Files Required

This directory needs the following files for the Lanyard component to work properly:

## card.glb
- A 3D model file in GLB format
- Should contain geometry for: card, clip, and clamp objects
- Materials: base (for card surface) and metal (for clip/clamp)

## lanyard.png
- Texture image for the rope/lanyard material
- Should be a repeating pattern suitable for rope rendering
- Recommended size: 256x256 or 512x512 pixels

## Temporary Solution
Since these assets are not provided, you'll need to either:
1. Create/source these files yourself
2. Replace the import paths with placeholder assets
3. Modify the component to work without these specific assets

For now, the component will show errors until these files are available.
